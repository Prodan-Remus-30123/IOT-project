🌿 Smart Automated Irrigation & Remote Plant Monitoring System
Overview

This project implements a fully automated irrigation system that leverages light, humidity, and temperature sensors to optimize plant care. The system ensures that plants receive the optimal amount of water by dynamically adjusting irrigation levels based on real-time environmental conditions.

Additionally, I developed an Android application that allows users to remotely monitor plant conditions and manually adjust settings to maintain the ideal growing environment. The project integrates C++ (Arduino), serial communication, and interrupt-based programming to enhance efficiency and responsiveness.
🚀 Features
🔹 Automated Irrigation System

    🌧 Smart Watering: Uses humidity sensors to detect soil moisture levels and trigger irrigation only when needed.
    ☀️ Light Sensors: Adjusts irrigation based on sunlight exposure to prevent overwatering.
    🌡 Temperature Monitoring: Ensures optimal plant health by adapting to environmental conditions.

🔹 Remote Monitoring & Control

    📱 Android App Integration: Developed a mobile application that displays real-time sensor data and allows remote control of the system.
    🌍 Cloud Connectivity: Sends real-time updates to the mobile app.
    ❄️ Remote Temperature Control: Users can manually adjust temperature settings through the app.

🔹 Advanced Hardware & Software Implementation

    ⚡ Interrupt-Based Programming: Optimized response time by using hardware and software interrupts in C++ (Arduino).
    🔗 Serial Communication: Used UART serial communication to exchange data between the microcontroller and the Android app.
    🚀 Low-Power Mode: Implemented an energy-efficient design to minimize power consumption.
